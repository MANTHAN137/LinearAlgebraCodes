# LinearAlgebraCodes
In the third semester of B.Tech ,we learned the subject called Linear Algrebra .
Using by coding knowledge, I implemented some the method related  to the matrix manipulations.
This code are helpful in problem solving 3X3 size matrices only of the folling methods:
1]Gauss-Jacobi-Method
2]Gauss-Sidel_and_SOR-Method
3]Crout's     -Method
4]LU Decompositin Method
5]Cholesky    -Method
